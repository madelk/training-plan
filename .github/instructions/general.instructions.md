This is a repo designed for the user to learn some languages. Take a look at /study-plan.md to understand what the user wants to learn
The user wants to learn the languaves, but not necessarily how to get things set up. So help the user set up the frameworks as much as possible.
Set up all the libraries and frameworks using NX ready for the user to start learning the languages.
Run tests using `npm test` to make sure any setup is created properly
Be sure to clean up after yourself. If you created backups or temporary files, delete them.
If you are not sure how to do something, ask the user for help, but generally try to figure it out yourself first and run unattended
Refer to NX's documentation for more information on how to set up libraries and frameworks: https://nx.dev/latest/react/getting-started/intro
Verify what you have done by running the tests using `npm test` and look at pending git changes using `git status`
